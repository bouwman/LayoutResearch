# Icon Layout Study

Welcome to the visual search study on 'The Effect of Icon Arrangements in Circular Layouts' at the University College London.

To enroll in our study [download the Layout Research app on the App StoreÂ®](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1264525610?pt=84504800&ct=Website&mt=8).

## About our Study

Hexagonal layouts provide an alternative way of arranging greater amounts of round icons. A prominent area where round icons are employed are smartwatches. Compared to a grid layout, hexagonal layouts increase screen density while maintaining the same minimum distance between round icons as a grid layout.

Studies have shown that increased screen density negatively impacts search performance of grid layouts. It has also been suggested that the effect of organisation diminishes with practice. However, it is unknown how these findings apply to hexagonal layouts. 

In the current software release for the Apple Watch, the app launcher is presented in a hexagonal layout. An in vivo study showed that people spend long time searching for apps on the Apple Watch. Another study emphasised that interactions with smartwatches are more brief and occur more frequently.

Thus, a layout that supports quick interactions by minimising search time is very important for smartwatches. To date visual search in hexagonal layouts has not been investigated. The proposed study examines the impact of hexagonal layouts on search performance and learning.
